               <p> My name is Vinny DeStefano and I'm aspiring to be a successful web developer. I graduated from quinnipiac University.
                This is my first attempt at creating a website layout such as this! It was a little tricky at times but it was fun, to test out! I guess my love for solving puzzles will be great for web design! Lately I've been doing Sudoku, and it's been slowly eating away at my free time... but I love it!
                <br>
                <br>
                My interests incude playing video games, fishing, and cooking! Favorite game is Jak and Daxter, on playstation 2, my nostalgia is strong with that game. Favorite food is probably crab, all kinds of crab, there is no crab that i truly dislike. I've just picked up cooking but so far I make a mean Penne vodka!
